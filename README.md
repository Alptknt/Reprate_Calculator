# Reprate Calculator

A desktop application built with Python and Tkinter for calculating oscillator cavity frequencies, repetition rates, and fiber cavity lengths.  
Designed for laser physics applications with fiber + free-space cavities.

## âœ¨ Features
- Input fiber segment lengths and free-space distances
- Automatic calculation of:
  - Individual fiber delays
  - Total cavity time
  - Oscillator frequency (MHz)
  - Repetition rate multiples (2x, 4x, 8x, 16x) with required fiber lengths
- Adjustable constants for speed of light in glass and air
- Interactive UI with tooltips
- Includes schematic diagram and company branding
- Cross-platform: works on **Windows** and **macOS**
